On the other hand, if you want the customizations in this set to apply only to a specific process, select "Participatory processes" as the participatory space type and the target process as the participatory space. Furthermore, you can also apply the customizations to a specific component by defining the component for the constraint.</p> <p>If you define multiple constraints, the customizations will apply in all of those.</p>

            help_html: <p>A translation set is a "container" that holds the translations for a specific context you want to customize.</p> <p>Translation sets help you to organize your customizations and apply them to different contexts. This allows you to customize the same translation differently in different contexts.</p> <p>For example, if you want to customize a button with the term "Add" differently for different participatory processes, you can create separate translation sets for both processes and apply the set to those processes using the constraints.</p>
