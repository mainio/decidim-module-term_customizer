              to apply the customizations in a set to a specific context.</p> <p>In
              case you do not define any constraint rules, the customizations in this
              set will apply to the whole application. On the other hand, if you want
              the customizations in this set to apply only to a specific process,
              select "Participatory processes" as the participatory space type and
              the target process as the participatory space. Furthermore, you can
              also apply the customizations to a specific component by defining the
              component for the constraint.</p> <p>If you define multiple constraints,

            help_html: <p>A translation set is a "container" that holds the translations
              for a specific context you want to customize.</p> <p>Translation sets
              help you to organize your customizations and apply them to different
              contexts. This allows you to customize the same translation differently
              in different contexts.</p> <p>For example, if you want to customize
              a button with the term "Add" differently for different participatory
              processes, you can create separate translation sets for both processes
              and apply the set to those processes using the constraints.</p>
